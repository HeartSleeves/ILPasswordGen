# ILPasswordGen

Password generator created by Ivy Lovegood

To use this password generator, simply press the "generate password" button on the screen. You will be prompted to choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters. The following prompts will ask you to allow or disallow special characters, numbers, and upper case letters. A final confirmation prompt will display your choices and allow you to generate your requested password, or restart the process.

This code creates an array of lower case letters as a baseline for password generation. Depending on user input, upper case letters, numbers, and special characters will be added. On final confirmation of user-selected parameters, a password will be randomly generated from the user-selected array.
